# MVVM_MarvelAPI_Combine
## _Used combine framework for app with marvel api_


## Features

- No Storyboard: View develop 100% in code,
- This app is using MVVM Architecture
- List of superheroes limited to 20 items per page
- It should be possible to filter characters by name
- Pagination according to the number of super heroes.
- Used combine framework for app with marvel api
- Calling to the API has been made without any third library.
- I have used Generics type for the Network layer because if you want to fetch comics from the API, just need to create the Comic model and pass it to the Network layer.
- Just for lack of time, I did NOT add any other extra feature: Unit Testing and UI Testing complete App. (some Unit test cases added code coverage percentage 54.6%)
